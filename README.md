# Quantitative Cost Assessment of IaC Testing: Proof of Concept Implementation

**WIP: This repository is a work in progress.**

This repository is a work in progress and part of ongoing research for a master thesis scheduled for completion in February 2024.
Up until that point, the project may undergo significant changes and updates, including its documentation which is currently rudimentary, consisting of placeholders or still to-do.
Nonetheless, feedback is highly encouraged, particularly concerning different test approaches and test case implementations.

## Introduction

[Placeholder]

This repository contains the proof of concept implementation for the master thesis titled "Quantitative Cost Assessment of IaC Testing". The purpose of this implementation is to gather empirical data that serves to quantitatively assess the costs associated with testing Infrastructure as Code (IaC) configurations.

## Requirements

To run this proof of concept, you will need:

[TODO]

## Usage

## Metrics Collected

[PLACEHOLDER]

The proof of concept implementation captures several key metrics such as:

- Execution time
- Resource consumption
- Monetary costs

These metrics are collected to facilitate the quantitative cost assessment of IaC testing, as discussed in the thesis.

## Acknowledgment

The "Configuration under Test" (CUT), which is the Terraform configuration utilized in this implementation, was originally developed by Mattia Caracciolo for his thesis titled "Policy as Code, how to automate cloud compliance verification with open-source tools".
Mattia did not publish his code but graciously permitted us to adapt and publish the code for the purpose of this thesis.
We extend our sincere thanks to Mattia for his contribution.
